3) Install googleapis node module by typing to terminal - `npm install googleapis`
4) **Make sure you have initilized localization of your app in Xcode** by adding necessary languages in corresponding dialog window. This step creates `lproj` folders with and integrates them to your `xcodeproj`.

### Usage

Your sheet in Google Sheets should have format like this

KEY | Language 1 | Language 2 | Other languages
--- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------
term_key_0 | Language 1 translation of term | Language 2 translation of term | Language 3 translation of term
term_key_1 | Language 1 translation of term | Language 2 translation of term | Language 3 translation of term
term_key_2 | Language 1 translation of term | Language 2 translation of term | Language 3 translation of term

Language 1, Language 2 etc. are language codes relative to ISO 639-1 (en for English, fr for French etc.).

**Important!** Make sure the sheet that contains localizations has name `LocalizableStrings`.

You will need an `ID` of your Google spreadsheet. You can obtain it from url while spreadsheet is open:

There are 3 available modes of execution:

* `strings`
* `plist`
* `strings+plist`

To localize `Info.plist` in your app you should add a page to your Google Sheet with name `LocalizablePlist`.

To specify mode you should pass one after `-m` token.
Default is `strings`.

To execute script, locate directory containing contents of this repo in Terminal. 

Type `node GenerateLocalizable.js -m SELECTED_MODE -i YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID -e EXPORT_PATH`

Where `EXPORT_PATH` can be any path, but most likely you would like to export localization straight to your project.
In this case, specify path to directory where your `*.lproj` folders are stored in your project. For example `/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Documents/YOUR_PROJECT_NAME/Resources`.

During first run you will be prompted to authorize, follow the instructions in Terminal.
After authorization, process continues and if everything is OK, message will appear: Success! ðŸ¤©
